Powder is the future of all torrent requirements, it's a hybrid between a Torrent Client ([Peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix)) and a Customized Player ([WebChimera.js](https://github.com/RSATom/WebChimera.js)).

It can do everything that a Torrent Client can, everything that a Video/Audio Player can and much more!
