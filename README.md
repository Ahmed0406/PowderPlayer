Powder is the future of all torrent requirements, it's a hybrid between a Torrent Client ([Peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix)) and a Customized Player ([WebChimera](http://www.webchimera.org/)).

It can do everything that a Torrent Client can, everything that a Video/Audio Player can and much more!

*When streaming a Video from a Torrent, you can Right Click and select Torrent Data in order to see the Torrent Control Panel.*
